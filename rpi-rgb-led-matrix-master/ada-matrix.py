# DriverAdaMatrix provides a driver plugin for use with BiblioPixel: https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/BiblioPixel
# BiblioPixel is a write once, run on anything interface for LED animations on just about any hardware
# Install with "pip install bibliopixel" or download from GitHub
# Due to the Adafruit_RGBmatrix requirement, this code will only run on the Raspberry Pi

# #Usage is as follows:
# #See the Wiki for more details: https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/BiblioPixel/wiki

# from bibliopixel import *
# import bibliopixel.colors as colors
# from ada-matrix import DriverAdaMatrix

# driver = DriverAdaMatrix(rows=32, chain=1)
# driver.SetPWMBits(6) #decrease bit-depth for better performance
# #MUST use serpentine=False because rgbmatrix handles the data that way
# led = LEDMatrix(driver, 32, 32, serpentine=False)

# #Must have code downloaded from GitHub for matrix_animations
# from matrix_animations import *
# import bibliopixel.log as log
# log.setLogLevel(log.DEBUG)


# try:
#     anim = ScrollText(led, "Hello World!", size=4)
#     anim.run()
# except KeyboardInterrupt:
#     led.all_off()
#     led.update()
